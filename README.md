# Smart Home Electricity Usage Estimator

The **Smart Home Electricity Usage Estimator** is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to help users understand how much electricity their household appliances consume. By entering the power rating and daily usage of each appliance, this tool calculates energy consumption, estimates monthly electricity bills, identifies high-consumption devices, and encourages energy-saving habits. The project is simple, practical, and perfect for students, hobbyists, and anyone who wants better control over their electricity usage.

##  Why This Project?

Electricity bills can be confusing, and most households don’t know which appliances consume the most power.  
This project solves that by providing:

- Simple & accurate consumption estimates  
- Awareness about high-energy devices  
- A tool to track electricity usage  
- A practical real-world mini-project ideal for college submissions  

This is not just an assignment-level project — it is actually useful in real life.

##  How the Program Works

### 1️⃣ User Inputs
- Appliance Name  
- Power Rating (W)  
- Daily Usage (hours)  
- Electricity Rate (₹ per kWh)

### 2️⃣ Calculations Performed

Formula used: Daily Energy (kWh) = (Watt × Hours) / 1000
Then:Monthly Consumption = Daily Energy × 30
Estimated Bill = Monthly Consumption × Electricity Rate

### 3️⃣ Output Provided

- Total daily consumption  
- Total monthly consumption  
- Estimated monthly bill  
- Highest consuming appliance (with exact kWh usage)

## 🖥️ Example Usage

Enter appliance name: Fan
Power rating (W): 75
Daily usage (hours): 8

Enter appliance name: Refrigerator
Power rating (W): 150
Daily usage (hours): 24

Enter electricity rate (₹ per kWh): 8

Program Output:
Total daily consumption: 4.2 kWh
Total monthly consumption: 126 kWh
Estimated monthly bill: ₹1008
Highest consuming appliance: Refrigerator (108 kWh/month)
